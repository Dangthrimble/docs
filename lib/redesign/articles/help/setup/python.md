## Installing Python

Follow the instructions at [the Hitchhiker's Guide to Python](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/#getting-started) to install Python on your computer.


## Which version should I use?

All exercises have been tested with Python3.3 and Python2.7. If you want to use a different version you should be able solve most exercises just fine but may run into a SyntaxError here and there.


## Running a first test

Then run

```bash
$ python3 bob_test.py
```
