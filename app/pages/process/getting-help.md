## Stuck and need some help?

Everyone gets stuck on something or just needs to ask a quick question. Whether it's how to use the site or on a particular exercise there are plenty of people willing to help!

### IRC

There is an IRC room setup where you can go and ask questions or even help out others yourself.

If you have an [IRC client](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Internet_Relay_Chat_clients) feel free to connect to one of the many [Freenode servers](https://freenode.net/irc_servers.shtml).

You can also use the [Freenode webchat](https://webchat.freenode.net/), instead.

The room is ```#exercism``` and there's already a few folks waiting to help out!

### ScreenHero

If you need help and feel like it would be best to do a screen sharing session, [ScreenHero](http://screenhero.com/) has you covered. Feel free to ask through GitHub or IRC if anyone can help through a ScreenHero session.

### Google Hangouts

There has been some talk of having some Google Hangouts for folks to get together and talk about their code. Look for this in the near future!

### GitHub Issues

Of course, if all else fails, feel free to [log an issue](https://github.com/exercism/exercism.io/issues/new) through GitHub and someone will follow up on it.
