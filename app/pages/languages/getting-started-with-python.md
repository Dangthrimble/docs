If Python isn't already available on your system follow the instructions at [the Hitchhiker's Guide to Python](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/#getting-started) to install Python on your computer.

Exercism currently supports Python3.4, Python3.3 and Python2.7.

## Running tests

Execute tests with:

```bash
$ cd exercism/project/directory/bob
$ python bob_test.py
```

## Formatting your code

There's a style guide called [PEP8](http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) that many Python projects adhere to.
[autopep8](https://github.com/hhatto/autopep8) is a command line tool that can point you at formatting problems in your code and automatically fix them.
Install it with [pip](http://pip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/):

```bash
$ pip install autopep8
```
